# base16-onedarker-scheme
This is a base16 scheme roughly based on the 256-color version of the onedark.vim project (https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim).

Note that the 256-color version looks quite a bit different than the standard ansi one. For a scheme based on the ansi theme, see https://github.com/tilal6991/base16-onedark-scheme.
